/*
    Create a variable for each of the above steps of the Software Development Lifecycle and set the values of each variable to a definition of the step.
    The first one is done for you.

const planning = "This is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined. Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added." 

const Implementation = "this is the process where developers write/implement the code that is used to solve a particular problem."

const Design = "This is the process where designers come up with mockup versions of how they want a software to look and be used"

const Maintain = "This is process that comes after codes have been deployed and up and running.In this stage codes are undergoing maintainence checks and fixing bugs. "

const AnalysisofRequirements = "This is the stage were a developer gathers information that would help the process of building the software"

const TestingandIntegration = "This is the stage were a developer tests the software to ensure maximum efficiency"
